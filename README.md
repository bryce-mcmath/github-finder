# Github Finder

This is a small React app that interacts with the github API. It was created to help familiarize myself with React, class components, function components, lifecycle methods, prop-types, react-router-dom, hooks, and the Context API.

## Use it Live

[Github Finder](https://githubfinder662.netlify.com/)

## Download and run locally

To download this repository and use it locally run `git clone https://github.com/bryce-mcmath/github-finder.git`
in your terminal. Create a .env.local file that includes the following:

`REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='{your github client id}' REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET='{your github client secret here}'`

If you don't have an ID and secret for the github API you can grab one [here,](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) using http://localhost:3000 as your home and callback URL.

Finally, in your terminal input `npm run start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
